FM-WebDirect-Login
==================

This file is presented as a learning tool for customizing the login appearance for FileMaker WebDirect. It involves the following:

    1. FileMaker Layouts that will be shown in WebDirect when logging in.
    2. Security configuration for providing "public" credentials to a file ONLY for WebDirect.
    3. auto-login.php file to redirect users directly into a WebDirect session.
    4. Options for handling the login process.
    5. Error trapping successful logins.

The included FileMaker file "Login.fmp12" is used to demonstrate scripting, layouts and security configuration. To use the file, the default username and password is:

user: admin
pass: admin

You can change this as needed if hosting on your own server, and use for reference in your own files.
